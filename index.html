                        The"Millennial Pets" is a comic strip project that provides a perspective on the social issues seen through the eyes of fascinating animals. The comic strip stars a sophisticated sphynx cat, an adventurer puffy, a technophile pinscher, among others.             
                                                
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       We are trying to show a dose of eflection about essential issues from the millennium, such as climate change, waste and consumption, deforestation, racism, etc.                         
                    </p> 
                     <p>
                        We believe that comics convey meaning to people more efficiently than any other form of art, with economy and accuracy, to get to the heart of the matter. 
                        It will also be much appreciated for any kind of financial assistance for this project.                                                
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Thank you for your generosity!                         
                    </p>

                    <p>                        
                        Goals: To make this project come to fruition, we need some financial assistance. Our goal is to reach $300 per month. With that we can continue to create more comic strips, have a website, make prizes available, and much more.
